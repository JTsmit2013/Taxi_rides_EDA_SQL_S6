# Taxi Rides Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes taxi ride data in Chicago to uncover insights about taxi company performance, drop-off patterns, and ride durations under specific conditions. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing using Python.

---

## Data Sources
### CSV Files Provided:
1. **`/datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv`**  
   - `company_name`: Taxi company name  
   - `trips_amount`: Number of rides on November 15-16, 2017  

2. **`/datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv`**  
   - `dropoff_location_name`: Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended  
   - `average_trips`: Average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017  

3. **`/datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv`**  
   - `start_ts`: Pickup date and time  
   - `weather_conditions`: Weather conditions at the ride's start time  
   - `duration_seconds`: Ride duration in seconds

## Steps to Complete the Project

### Step 1: Data Import
- Load the datasets into Python using `pandas`.

### Step 2: Data Exploration
- Inspect the data for completeness, consistency, and correctness.
- Ensure proper data types for each column.

### Step 3: Data Analysis
1. **Dataset 1 (`project_sql_result_01.csv`):**
   - Analyze taxi companies and the number of rides.
   - Visualize the number of rides for each taxi company using a bar graph.

2. **Dataset 2 (`project_sql_result_04.csv`):**
   - Identify the top 10 neighborhoods with the highest number of drop-offs.
   - Create a bar graph to visualize the drop-offs in these neighborhoods.

3. **Insights and Conclusions:**
   - Summarize findings based on the visualizations, such as identifying high-performing taxi companies and popular drop-off areas.

### Step 4: Hypothesis Testing
- Use `project_sql_result_07.csv` to test the hypothesis:  
  **"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."**

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): The average ride duration on rainy Saturdays is the same as on non-rainy Saturdays.  
   - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\)): The average ride duration on rainy Saturdays differs from non-rainy Saturdays.

2. **Set the Significance Level:**
   - Decide on an alpha value (e.g., 0.05).

3. **Select Statistical Test:**
   - Use a two-sample t-test for comparing mean ride durations under the two conditions. Ensure assumptions for the t-test are met.

4. **Perform the Test:**
   - Conduct the test using `scipy.stats`.
   - Analyze the p-value to accept or reject the null hypothesis.

5. **Conclude:**
   - Summarize the findings and their implications.
